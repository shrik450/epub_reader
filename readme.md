# ePub.js Reader

This is a simple static site that serves as an epub reader. I needed a
lightweight epub reader that I could theme easily; nothing is more lightweight
and cross platform than a bunch of client-side JS and theming is a cinch with
CSS. There's nothing smart or special here; most of this is adapted verbatim
from epub.js's examples, with a few changes for my personal use. The only
"special" thing is using Local Storage to keep track of last read positions so
you can come back to a book later.
